This example shows how we might be having different booking
systems such as train, flight and bus. Each of these systems 
will have it's own way of how to book the ticket, but with having
the facade I can just book tickets from different subsystem
without really caring about how things are made in lower levels.

The idea of the facade is to just have the interfaces that I need
to complete the task.
